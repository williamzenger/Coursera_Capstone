## Real Estate & Venues Data Analysis of Wuxi City, China


#### I. 		Introduction

##### A. Description & Background information
  **Wuxi City** is a new first-tier city of China which located in the northeast of Shanghai. One of my friend wants to buy an apartment and has much interest in Wuxi. Because not only the price of apartment is much lower than in Shanghai but also it only takes about 30 mins to Shanghai via the high speed train(we're both working in Shanghai). Since then, I viewed one of the most big real estate website: [BeiKe](https://wx.fang.ke.com/loupan/pg1) to check out how many (apartments) options we have.

  As we can see, there are about six hundread results so he's confused and don't know how to choose. So here is the question: **how can we decide which one is the most appropriate apartment?** Meanwhile, to increase the standard of living, we need to consider that if there are any restaurants, hospitals and schools, etc nearby as well. And I'll call these as *'features'* in this report.
